          "reasoning": "With the very first pick we want the single biggest points-ceiling asset at the scarcest position. Haaland is a proven 20-30-goal striker in a dominant Man City attack and clearly projects above every other forward on the board, whereas elite midfield scores (Salah, Saka, Palmer, Son, etc.) are still plentiful for our next turn. Locking in Haaland gives us a weekly set-and-forget starter up front and lets us build the midfield depth later where the talent pool remains deep."

          "reasoning": "We need to start building a strong midfield core and \u00d8degaard offers an elite, nailed-on 90-minute attacker for Arsenal with proven FPL output and set-piece duty. While Marmoush ranks slightly higher, his minutes at Man City are uncertain and we already own a City asset (Haaland). \u00d8degaard gives us reliability, captaincy upside in plum fixtures, and keeps our Man City slots flexible for later value picks. Securing a premium, dependable midfielder now lets us use our immediate Round 3 pick (coming next) to address another position before the talent pool thins."

            "draft_rank": 14
          },
          "reasoning": "We still need four more midfielders and very few top-tier options remain. Mbeumo is a proven FPL points-getter and now joins a stronger Man United attack, offering both goal and assist upside with nailed minutes and penalty duties. He\u2019s the highest-quality, lowest-risk asset left in the elite tier (rank 14) and will likely be snapped up before our next pick at 28, whereas no defender or goalkeeper is being drafted yet and plenty of solid options will still be there in 12 picks\u2019 time."

            "draft_rank": 77
          },
          "reasoning": "We have no defenders yet and must fill five spots; locking in the highest-upside DEF on the board is critical before the run on the position starts. Frimpong\u2019s move to Liverpool puts him in a strong defence while his wing-back style offers big attacking returns, giving premium value in one pick. We can address forward or another need with our immediate next pick at 29, but securing this scarce top-tier defender now protects us from being left short at the back."

          },
          "reasoning": "We only have one forward (Haaland) and need two more, while quality strikers are thinning out fast. Evanilson is the highest-ranked forward left (36), arrives as Bournemouth\u2019s record signing and is nailed to start, offering secure minutes and a good xG profile. With 12 picks before we draft again several managers still need strikers, so a forward run is likely; top defenders should still be available (Gabriel, Saliba, Virgil, Robertson, etc.) next time. Locking in Evanilson now secures a strong FWD2 and keeps roster balance."

          },
          "reasoning": "A mini-run on premium defenders has started (Robertson, Saliba, Gvardiol just went) and we only own one DEF so far. Van Dijk (\u201cVirgil\u201d) is the last nailed-on, 90-minute elite option from a top-four back-line still on the board, giving us clean-sheet stability to balance Frimpong\u2019s attacking risk. Because we pick again immediately at 43, we can address midfield or forward next, so locking in this cornerstone defender now maximises squad structure and value."

          },
          "reasoning": "Midfield is our biggest remaining need and Arsenal\u2019s Martinelli offers a nailed-on starting spot in a top-three attack with high goal/assist potential. He\u2019s better FPL value and more secure minutes than higher-ranked names like Kluivert or Schade, and he will almost certainly be gone before our next turn in 13 picks. We can still address keeper, extra defenders and our bench forward later, as plenty of options remain at those positions."

          },
          "reasoning": "Best value on the board (rank 39), fills a midfield slot we still need, and offers high upside in Man City\u2019s attack. Goalkeepers and extra defenders can be taken later, while elite attacking options will dry up quickly, so locking in Savinho now maximises points potential before we use our immediate next pick on a forward or other need."

          },
          "reasoning": "Forward depth is thin in a 7-team draft and several managers still need strikers. Richarlison is the highest-ranked FWD left (63) and should lead the line for an attack-minded Spurs side even after Kudus\u2019 arrival. Securing our third starting forward now locks in a weekly starter before a likely mini run on strikers, while quality mids and goalkeepers (e.g. Ederson, Pickford, Rice, Doku) are still plentiful and more likely to last until our next pick at 70."

          "reasoning": "He\u2019s the highest-ranked player left on the board (45), immediately completes our midfield quota, and offers goal-scoring upside in an Everton side that badly needs creativity \u2013 meaning he should be nailed for minutes and bonus. Because we pick again at 71 we can address defence or goalkeeper straight away, so locking in the best value mid now maximises roster strength while the deeper DEF/GKP pools remain plentiful."

          "reasoning": "We still need three more defenders and two goalkeepers.  Quality defenders who are guaranteed starters at elite clean-sheet clubs will disappear quickest, while there are still plenty of serviceable keepers left.  \u201cR\u00faben\u201d (Dias) is Manchester City\u2019s nailed-on centre-back, offers 38-game security and consistent clean-sheet/bonus potential, and gives us coverage from a second top-tier defence to balance our double-Liverpool back line.  The other high-rank defenders (James, Timber) carry significant injury/rotation risk, and solid goalkeepers such as S\u00e1nchez, Pope or Vicario should still be available 12 picks from now.  Locking in City defensive reliability here maximises value and lets us address goalkeeper in the next turn."

          "reasoning": "We still need two reliable defenders and Ben White offers the best mix of nailed-on minutes, clean-sheet potential and occasional attacking returns in the pool. Arsenal\u2019s defence is among the league\u2019s strongest, and White is more rotation-proof than the similarly-ranked Man City options while carrying higher upside than Branthwaite (Everton\u2019s weaker CS outlook). Because we hold the very next pick as well, we can safely lock in this high-value defender now and address goalkeeper with pick 85, when several comparable keepers will still be on the board."

          "reasoning": "We still have zero goalkeepers and only three picks left, so locking in a nailed-on starter is priority #1. Guglielmo Vicario is Spurs\u2019 clear No. 1, offers strong clean-sheet and save potential, and is less rotation-prone than S\u00e1nchez (risk of Petrovi\u0107) or any of the Man City backups. Top-rank defenders like Branthwaite will probably still have decent alternatives in 13 picks\u2019 time, whereas quality starting keepers could dry up quickly with several rivals still needing one or two. Securing Vicario now gives us a safe GK anchor and lets us address the final DEF and second GK with our last two selections."

          "reasoning": "We still need one defender and one backup keeper. With two back-to-back picks (98 and 99) we can lock both positions in, so we\u2019ll first grab the clear-standout defender on the board. John Stones (rank 161) gives elite clean-sheet potential, occasional attacking returns in Pep\u2019s inverted role and pairs well with our already-owned R\u00faben Dias. Because we already have four nailed defenders, we can absorb his rotation risk and take the high upside, then use pick 99 for the safer goalkeeper option."

Alphonse Areola is West Ham\u2019s clear No.1, giving us guaranteed starts, plenty of save/bonus potential, and good fixture rotation with Vicario for tougher Spurs games or possible blanks.

Other top forwards (Watkins, Isak, Ekitik\u00e9, Gy\u00f6keres, Bowen, Cunha, Mbeumo) have already been taken, making forward depth thin. The next best forwards are significant steps down in reliability and upside. With strong midfield already, prioritizing striker now better suits flexibility before defensive or keeper runs begin.

Mateta is the highest-ranked available forward and offers strong value as Palace\u2019s main striker. Midfield depth remains high on the board (with Gibbs-White, Gakpo, etc. still available), so it\u2019s safer to secure a forward now before the pool dries up.

'Trossard' is a versatile Arsenal midfielder/forward with real attacking threat and likely starting minutes after Arsenal's summer business. He\u2019s one of the best available midfielders still on the board, offers some goal and assist potential, and helps to ensure I don\u2019t miss out on the best available mids as teams fill up their starting XIs.

Although there are a few midfielders ranked slightly higher, Mitoma's proven track record and nailed-on status makes him a safer pick for both immediate and long-term value. Midfield options get thin fast in 7-team drafts, and with so many teams filling their mid rotations, this is a critical spot to secure a top-50, Premier League-proven starter. Defensive depth and goalkeepers can still be targeted in the next rounds, where the difference in quality is less stark."

'Pedro Porro' of Spurs offers proven Premier League quality, strong attacking returns for a defender, and is nailed in a good team with improving clean sheet potential. He is higher value than most available defenders, offers more upside than other defensive options, and defenders will likely start flying off the board soon given how thin the top tier is.

This gives reliability in a position where alternatives quickly become unreliable as the pool thins, and keeps flexibility for later rounds to chase outfield upside, since GKP scarcity can be a pain point. Only 2 GKP spots remain unfilled on your roster, so you can wait on a backup; take the clear first choice now."

'Tarkowski' is a nailed-on starter and set-piece threat for Everton, one of the most reliable defenders available. While his team is not elite, his appearance assurance, aerial ability, and bonus potential make him higher value than defenders of top clubs who rotate (e.g., 'J.Timber', 'James'). There is risk others will begin shoring up defense soon, and this pick is best for both floor and availability."

Considering that the next available forwards have slightly lower draft value and there\u2019s a high risk that others will take the better strikers soon as teams fill out their squads, Barry is the best balance between immediate positional need and player value. I can return to strengthen my defense in upcoming rounds where quality options like Timber, Branthwaite, and Sch\u00e4r should still be available, but the drop-off at forward becomes steep quickly in a seven-team draft pool."

He is the highest-ranked available defender, plays for a top club likely to secure clean sheets, and offers potential attacking returns given City's style. While Man City rotation risk exists, the ceiling is notably higher than with most other available defenders. Goalkeeper depth can be addressed with the next pick, as many remain. This balances positional need, player quality, and maximizing value at this stage."

He offers attacking threat on set pieces and is a flexible asset, covering both center-back and left-back roles.

He is currently Ederson's backup at Man City, so he offers perfect handcuff/insurance if Ederson were to get injured or rotated. No starter is truly left in this pool, so maximizing value at this spot means locking up one of the league's best defenses for all situations. Additionally, selecting an alternative like Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1 or Verbruggen offers less upside and team cover. Given your strong outfield, maximizing security at goalkeeper is priority."

He was a top-tier fantasy asset last season with 11 goals and 10 assists in a strong Newcastle side.

This adds a second high-quality midfielder to my roster alongside Foden."

Gabriel is a nailed-on starter for what is arguably the best defense in the league, offering both high clean sheet potential and significant goal threat from set pieces. Picking him now provides a high-floor, high-ceiling foundation for my backline, addressing a major positional need with a premium asset."

Robertson has a proven track record of delivering both defensive and attacking returns at the highest level. With four defender slots to fill and only one currently occupied, this pick addresses a major positional need with a premium, set-and-forget asset. Given the number of teams needing defenders and goalkeepers, waiting would risk missing out on the top tier of talent in these scarcer positions."

I am capitalizing on this market inefficiency to draft the consensus best goalkeeper in the league. This move secures a reliable, high-scoring player at a position where a run is imminent. While elite defenders like Trippier and Porro are tempting, the opportunity to get the undisputed #1 at a '1 of 1' position is too valuable to pass up. I can address my other needs with my upcoming picks from a deep pool of available outfield players."

Despite some rotation risk, his underlying statistics are elite, and he plays for one of the most potent attacks in the league. Securing him completes an incredibly strong forward line with Watkins and Havertz, giving my team a massive ceiling. While I still need midfielders, the drop-off in quality at the forward position feels more significant, and I'm confident I can acquire quality midfielders in the upcoming rounds."

Kudus is the highest-ranked player left on the board and just secured a major transfer to an attacking Spurs side where he should be a focal point. The drop-off in quality to the next available midfielders feels significant, so I want to lock in this high-upside player now. While there is strong value in defense, the pool of available midfielders with Kudus's potential is nearly empty."

As Newcastle's primary set-piece taker, he offers elite attacking potential from the back, something that is rare and incredibly valuable in FPL. Despite his low pre-draft ranking here, his proven FPL track record makes him an absolute steal at pick 66 and the clear best player available."

He is a guaranteed starter for the best team in the league and was one of the highest-scoring midfielders in FPL last season. Despite his deeper role, he consistently provides goals, assists, and significant bonus points, offering a high and reliable floor. This pick adds a core of consistent points to my midfield, balancing out other higher-risk, high-reward players on my roster. Given the talent drop-off in midfield, he is the clear best player available."

With only one forward position left to draft, securing a top-tier forward like Wissa adds depth and scoring potential, especially since other teams are actively picking forwards (e.g., Wood in the last pick). Although midfield and defense are also urgent needs, the value here outweighs delaying, as comparable midfielders like Gibbs-White (rank 25) are slightly lower ranked, and defenders/goalkeepers can be targeted in later rounds when more options remain."

Henderson (rank 221) is a solid starter for Crystal Palace with good potential for saves and clean sheets. With only 5 picks until my next selection (pick 99), there's high risk that top GKP like Henderson or Leno could be taken, leaving weaker options.

Haaland is a proven 20-30-goal striker in a dominant Man City attack and clearly projects above every other forward on the board, whereas elite midfield scores (Salah, Saka, Palmer, Son, etc.) are still plentiful for our next turn. Locking in Haaland gives us a weekly set-and-forget starter up front and lets us build the midfield depth later where the talent pool remains deep.",
